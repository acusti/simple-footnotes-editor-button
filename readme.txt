Add a button to the TinyMCE editor toolbar to make it easy for users to add footnotes with the proper syntax for the Simple Footnotes plugin.

== Description ==

The [Simple Footnotes](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-footnotes/) plugin allows you to add simple, elegant footnotes on your site.

This tiny plugin makes it incredibly simple to create those footnotes, leaving nothing to teach the site’s editors (no need to explain shortcodes or special syntaxes). It adds a button to the TinyMCE editor toolbar in the second row that users can click to display a textarea where they can enter the footnote content and then add footnotes with the proper syntax.
