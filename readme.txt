Add a button to the TinyMCE editor toolbar to make it easy for users to add footnotes with the proper syntax for the Simple Footnotes plugin.

== Description ==

The [Simple Footnotes](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-footnotes/) plugin allows you to add simple, elegant footnotes on your site.

This tiny plugin makes it incredibly simple to create those footnotes, leaving nothing to teach the siteâ€™s editors (no need to explain shortcodes or special syntaxes). It adds a button to the TinyMCE editor toolbar in the second row that users can click to display a textarea where they can enter the footnote content and then add footnotes with the proper syntax.
